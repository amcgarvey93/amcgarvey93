## ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Aaron, welcome to my portfolio!

Back in university I developed the R package [easypower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/easypower/index.html) to help make performing a power analysis and reading the output easier and more user friendly. I'm currently working at [The Sales Factory](https://www.thesalesfactory.co/) and responsible for all data operations. The main focus of my work is to develop integrations with our systems, automate reporting tasks, and create more efficient workflows. 

### What are some things I actively work on?
- Developing easy to use apps in R Shiny for quick product development and testing. Some of these apps utilize persistent data storage to edit fields in  our database and sync with other systems
- Using CRM APIs to develop integrations so we can have more oversight on our work. I've developed 'call log' integrations for HubSpot, Outreach, and Salesforce is currently in the works
- 

### What languages am I using right now?
- Python
- R
- SQL (Postgres)
