## 👋 Hi, I’m Aaron, welcome to my portfolio!

I'm an Online Fitness Coach and Business Development Rep at [The Sales Factory](https://www.thesalesfactory.co/). Currently improving my R programming skills and completing
projects to build my experience.

### I'm working towards becoming a data analyst!
- I developed the R package [easypower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/easypower/index.html) back in 2015 to help make performing a power analysis and reading the output
easier and more user friendly
- I have a passion for coding and working with data

### 🏆 Goals for 2022
- Become proficient in R and learn machine learning models
- Complete Google Data Analyst Certification
- Learn SQL
- Dable in some Python for web scraping
