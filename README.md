## üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Aaron, welcome to my portfolio!

I'm an Online Fitness Coach and Business Development Rep at [The Sales Factory](https://www.thesalesfactory.co/). Currently improving my R programming skills and completing
projects to build my experience.

### I'm working towards becoming a data analyst!
- I developed the R package [easypower](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/easypower/index.html) back in 2015 to help make performing a power analysis and reading the output
easier and more user friendly
- I'm currently working on automating data collection from the Hubspot API using Python. (Program overview coming soon! The data and information is private so I will be putting together a modified version)

### üèÜ Goals for 2022
- Become proficient in R and learn machine learning models
- Learn SQL and Python
- Choose a BI software to learn

For additional projects and interactive graphics, head over to my profile on [RPubs](https://rpubs.com/McGarveyA)!
